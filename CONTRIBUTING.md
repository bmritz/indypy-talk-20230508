## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.7+ and the following tools:

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)
- [nox-poetry](https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/)

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ make install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ .poetry/bin/poetry run python
$ .poetry/bin/poetry run indypy-talk-20230508
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ make run-nox-all
```

List nox sesssions:

```console
$ .poetry/bin/poetry run nox --list
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ NOXSESSION=<session-name> make run-nox-session
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ NOXSESSION='pre-commit -- install' make run-nox-session
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
